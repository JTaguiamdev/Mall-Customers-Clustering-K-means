    "### Understanding the WCSS Results for Different Values of K\n",
    "\n",
    "The values below show how the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) changes as we increase the number of clusters (K):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **K=2: WCSS=588.80**\n",
    "- **K=3: WCSS=476.79**\n",
    "- **K=4: WCSS=388.72**\n",
    "- **K=5: WCSS=331.31**\n",
    "- **K=6: WCSS=276.41**\n",
    "- **K=7: WCSS=236.20**\n",
    "- **K=8: WCSS=199.75**\n",
    "- **K=9: WCSS=174.24**\n",
    "- **K=10: WCSS=152.03**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this mean?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WCSS** measures the compactness of the clusters: the lower the WCSS, the closer the data points are to their cluster centers.\n",
    "- As K increases, WCSS decreases. Having more clusters usually means each point is closer to the center of its cluster.\n",
    "- However, after a certain K value, the decrease in WCSS becomes smaller (the curve flattens). This is known as the 'elbow' in the Elbow Method.\n",
    "- The 'elbow' point is the optimal K, balancing tight clusters with model simplicity. For this dataset, it is typically around K=5.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Choosing the right value of K using the Elbow Method helps us avoid over-segmentation while capturing the main patterns in customer behavior.*\n"
